    line: "Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a young prince named
      Aric. \r"

    line: "Aric was the only son of the king and queen, and was beloved by all in
      the kingdom. \r"
  - waitTime: 2
    line: "He was brave, kind, and just, and had a heart full of adventure.\r"

    line: "One day, while out on a hunting trip, Aric stumbled upon a mysterious
      cave deep in the forest. \r"
  - waitTime: 4
    line: "Being the curious soul he was, Aric decided to explore the cave, despite
      the warnings of his companions.\r"
  - waitTime: 5
    line: "As he ventured deeper into the cave, he came across a beautiful and powerful
      sorceress named Elara. \r"
  - waitTime: 6
    line: "She was the guardian of a magical artifact that had the power to grant
      wishes. \r"
  - waitTime: 7
    line: "Elara warned Aric that the artifact was not to be used lightly, for it
      could bring great harm as well as great good.\r"
  - waitTime: 8
    line: "Aric, determined to prove his worth, demanded that Elara give him the
      artifact. \r"
  - waitTime: 9
    line: "Elara refused, and a fierce battle ensued. Aric, with his bravery and
      strength, was able to defeat Elara and claim the artifact for himself.\r"
  - waitTime: 10
    line: "But with the artifact in his possession, Aric soon discovered that his
      greed for power had blinded him. \r"
  - waitTime: 11
    line: "He began to use the artifact recklessly, granting himself wealth, fame,
      and the love of his people. But as time passed, Aric's kingdom fell into chaos
      and ruin. \r"
  - waitTime: 12
    line: "The people, once happy and content, were now suffering under his rule.\r"
  - waitTime: 13
    line: "Realizing the error of his ways, Aric sought out Elara once more, begging
      for her forgiveness and guidance. \r"
  - waitTime: 14
    line: "Elara, moved by his remorse, helped Aric to use the artifact wisely and
      to rule justly. \r"
  - waitTime: 15
    line: "Under Aric's new leadership, the kingdom prospered once more, and the
      people were happy and content.\r"
  - waitTime: 16
    line: "From that day forward, Aric was known not only as a powerful ruler, but
      also as a wise and fair king. \r"
  - waitTime: 17
    line: And he lived the rest of his days in peace and happiness, always remembering
      the lesson that the artifact and Elara had taught him.
